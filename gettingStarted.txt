Thank you for choosing to download Acilos, private social valet. We appreciate your support.

To get started using the app there a few requirements and steps. You will need to install the following:
0) Install java (developed on 1.6 but later versions have been tested and work)

1) Apache/HTTPD - apt-get install apache/httpd

2) PHP - apt-get install php

3) NodeJS - apt-get install nodejs 

4) Composer - https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

5) download the Acilos tarball/source from https://github.com/omnibond/acilos

6) untar/install in a location so that the apache webroot points at acilos/src

7) from the acilos directory, run - make install - to download other dependencies, including DojoToolkit, nerveTattoo ES Client, AWS-client, and others. 

8) from the acilos/src directory run - php composer.phar self-update - then - sudo apt-get install php5-curl - and - 
php composer.phar install - to install any remaining dependencies 

9) start apache and from the acilos/src directory run - sudo sh start.sh - which will set up the data mining cronjobs, the cronManager shell scripts, start elasticsearch, and give all subsequent files and folders permissions.

9) Go to main domain page (http://YourDomain.com/) and you will be taken to the credentials page where you can follow our walkthroughs on setting up developer apps and adding in their key/secrets to the credentials page. After that is done you will be taken to login.php where you should log in normally with your account and begin using the app.
